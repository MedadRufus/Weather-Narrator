# Weather Narrator
 
Its a very busy day. The deadline is approaching. You need to keep track of time. 
You have not had time to leave the building. Time seems to fly and before you know it, evening happens. You had no idea
of what the weather was like outside. You lost track of time. It does not have to be that way!

Make your day better with the Weather Narrator!
At every 15 minutes( 0th, 15th, 30th, 45th minute of each hour), you get a simple notification of the time, weather and
a nice quote read out to you. No need to switch screens or look it up anywhere.

Stay informed!
